# Amazon RSU Vest Review Framework (Interactive)

This is a GitHub Pages-ready version of the interactive HTML framework.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload the contents of this folder (`index.html` and the `assets/` folder).
3. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` (or your default branch), `/root`
5. Save. GitHub will generate a public URL for the site.

## Notes
- `index.html` is fully self-contained and ready to publish.
- The logo is also included in `assets/` for future edits/branding updates.
